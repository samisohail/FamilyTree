Hi there,
I rekcon you're doing well. Hopefully program would run with any issues and tried to incorporate your last feedback in this submitted solution.

I am using FamilyDataBuilder.cs to build the tree which is having a list of commands/info to build family tree. Locally I was using a file with data/commands in it, worked okay but online had some file reading issue, therefore used a List<string>.

Looking for a very positive review and feedback!

PS: Locally for "GET_RELATIONSHIP Percy Daughter", I'm getting correct output i.e. Molly Lucy, but in submission test, output is NONE, cause test failure. Appreciate if you explain what went wrong in my code.

Thanks
